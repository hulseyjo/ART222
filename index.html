<h2> Project 1 Vector Graphics</h2>
<p> To make my digital design for Southworth Planetarium, I first wrote down everything I wanted to include in my design – elements of the planetarium, of Portland, Maine, and of USM. I laid out which elements I wanted to utilize from each of the main elements and tried to put them together in a few different ways. I drew out 2-3 different designs and then picked which one I liked the best to further edit and add more detail to. I knew right off the bat that I wanted to include the Portland skyline in some way and I knew I wanted to include some typography since I had never done that before and I thought it may add a unique element to the design. I found that drawing out my design ideas first helped me to transfer them into digital format more efficiently since the design process was already done, it just needed to be finalized as a digital design. 
<br>I am relatively happy with my overall design, although there are certainly parts of it I would improve or enhance if I were to do it again and there are things I would do differently for my next project. While I didn’t receive any feedback from classmates, I can agree with the feedback I received for my grade, which was spacing out “Southworth” and the edge of the city line and darkening the yellow to make it more visible. I knew I wanted to incorporate USM’s school colors but I wasn’t sure how well the yellow would work since it's such a light color. It works well against the dark colors, but definitely gets toned down next to the white background. <br>During this project, I learned more about design in general and how to use Adobe Illustrator. By actually playing around with the different tools and formatting options, I was able to understand how to work with digital design a bit better and gauge where I can improve or learn more. I am excited to continue working with Adobe Illustrator and improve my skills. </p>

<h3>Project 2 Photo Manipulation</h3>
<p>For this project, I decided to depict a utopia and dystopia centered around the themes of harmony and destruction. I created two different versions of the same reality, one where peace, harmony, and unity are central and the other one where violence, destruction, and chaos are central. The two worlds are meant to reflect a similar reality to ours, where the harmonious utopia is the ideal world and the destructive and violent dystopia is the world we are seemingly inching towards. 
The two compositions share some of the same features, like the discrete eyeballs hidden in the sky, the chess board, and the people. This was meant to bring the two compositions together in a way and make them feel like they are the same reality but two very different versions. I used two very distinct color palettes for each, which is supposed to add to the mood of each of the compositions. The yellow/gold used for the harmonious utopia brings the feeling of light and hope, whereas the red/orange used for the destructive dystopia brings the feeling of violence and darkness. 
I wanted to incorporate some unsettling themes into the utopia as well as the the dystopia to give the feeling that the utopia isn't as bright and perfect as it seems. The eyeballs are notably apart of the unsettling themes, insinuating that someone/something is always watching. The curtains were added to give the feeling that the utopia is all a show and that it might not even be real. The chess board and people in both pieces are supposed to represent the idea that its all a game and that the humans are apart of that game.</p>

<h4> Project 3 Video Art</h4>

<p>Bottled Emotions is about a person who breaks into the mental hospital seeking help, but in turn gets experimented on and forced into listening to a lecture on repeat until it begins to malfunction. Bottled Emotions explores a darker reality of mental hospitals, unlike the original video depicted, which was about a man's mundane journey through the mental hospital with a description of what the hospital has to offer. I wanted the video to be ominous and evoke a sense of discomfort. I used quick transitions and moments of pure darkness to create that eerie feeling. The man in the video is put to sleep where the mental hospital workers hook him up to a machine. The machine plays a lecture about emotions over and over again. As the lecture begins, it slowly begins to break down. The person who is being experimented on is waking up and becoming aware. I played around with the audio of the man giving the lecture to contribute to the feeling that the person is waking and becoming aware.
<br>I ended up basing my video around two main videos, “mental hospital” and “Control your Emotions”, and then used many supporting videos to help re-write the story. Along the way, the story I was creating changed quite a bit from my original idea, which I thought was pretty cool and I enjoyed the process of letting it flow. Overall, I like the video I produced. However, there are a few things I learned from this process that I would change for next time or do differently. I like the use of fast transitions and repetition of clips to convey the spooky, eerie feeling, but I could’ve played around more with editing tools and effects to add to that feeling more. I also think some elements of the audio could’ve been cleaner and more coherent. As far as the final project, I couldn’t figure out how to make the video fit in the full screen after uploading it. I went back and tried to edit it but I couldn’t figure it out. I could’ve spent more time making these edits and fixing the screen size if I didn’t procrastinate so much with this project, which is a big lesson I will take with me after this. For me, procrastination compromises the quality of my work and limits my creative expression to just what I can manage to get done in the short time I leave myself to do work, which is something I definitely want to fix for future creative or educational endeavors.
